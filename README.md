# Code_of_Competencies

This repository contains codes and notebooks with exploration data of the different competency platforms, such as: Kaggle, Tianchi, etc. With these codes I learned some techniques or metodologies, I enjoyed a lot the challenges and the learning process. In addition, I have  put more codes with modifications in my original codes.

The list is short, since generally in each competition I develop between 50 to 100 different models, different characteristics and techniques, and I do not want to put all the codes here.

Especially with these codes I learned something that helped me improve my ability in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

If you want to see more example codes in more competitions, you can go to the kaggle (or another platform) and look at the kernels section.
